# Possible Research Questions

*There is no organizational structure as of yet; feel free to introduce one.*

* What is the relationship between partial edits (in terms of location, code)?
* Are different patch locations run by different tests?
* Is there a way to tell if a bug requires a multiline change?
* Are there bugs that have multiple plausible patches, where one possible patch is a single line change, and one possible patch is a multi-edit change?
