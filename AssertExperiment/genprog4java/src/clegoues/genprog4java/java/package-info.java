 * 
 * The key difference between the functionality in this package and
 * other packages is basically that the functionality here does not 
 * know that it's part of a system for program repair/editing/transformation.
 * 
 * Basically, these classes all <i>collect and store</i> information about java
 * code, but do not manipulate it.
