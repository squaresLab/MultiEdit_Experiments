# MultiEdit Experiments

For best results, use Intellij and Maven.

Contents:

* Source code, in the `src` folder. We can probably use different packages for different kinds of experiments.
* A small test system, in module `SmallTestSystem`. This includes a small program, `Triangle`, and a complete test suite that was auto generated by EvoSuite.
* A file containing possible research questions we could study. In a file called `research_questions.md`.
* A draft paper in the `paper` directory.
